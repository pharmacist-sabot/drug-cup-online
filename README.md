## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Supabase Setup
1.  Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.io/).
2.  In the SQL Editor, run the SQL scripts for creating tables (`items_drugcupsabot`, `requisitions_drugcupsabot`, etc.) and setting up RLS policies.
3.  Navigate to **Project Settings > API**.
4.  Find your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**.

### Local Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pharmacist-sabot/drug-cup-online.git
    cd drug-cup-online
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Supabase credentials:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```

4.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
